# AutoExpense-Wizard

Welcome to AutoExpense-Wizard, a Flutter app designed to seamlessly track your income and expenses.

## Get Started

You can download the latest releases of the app [here](https://github.com/manohar-nalluri/AutoExpense-Wizard/releases).

## Future Goals

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fine Tuning

Our roadmap includes implementing NLP fine-tuning for machine learning models. This exciting feature will allow you to provide natural language input, and the model will autonomously categorize your income and expenses using TensorFlow Lite.

### Auto-detect Bank Messages

Imagine a world where you don't have to manually enter every transaction. AutoExpense-Wizard aims to make that a reality by automatically detecting incoming bank messages, whether they're credit or debit notifications. The NLP model will work its magic to categorize these transactions effortlessly.

## Budget Tracking

Keep your finances in check with our built-in budget tracking feature. The progress bar will visually represent your budget status:

- **Green Progress Bar:** Indicates budget is less than 50% utilized.
- **Yellow Progress Bar:** Indicates budget is between 50% and 70% utilized.
- **Red Progress Bar:** Indicates budget is more than 70% utilized.
